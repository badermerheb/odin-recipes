    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sometimes all you want at the end of the day is a simple cheese pizza.</p>
    <p>This recipe turns simple into sublime with the addition of an exceptional pizza dough, low-moisture mozzarella cheese, and an easy to make tomato sauce that hits all of the right sweet and savory notes to marry all of the flavors in this pie. A simple garnish of fresh herbs, and you've got perfection on a plate.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ball Artisan Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour, for dusting</li>
        <li>Semolina flour, for dusting</li>
        <li>¼ cup Basic Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces shredded low-moisture mozzarella</li>
        <li>Fresh basil or oregano leaves, for garnishing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Let chilled covered dough stand at room temperature until dough is cool (not cold) and a fingerprint remains when dough is pressed, 1 to 2 hours</li>
        <li>Transfer 1 dough ball to a heavily floured surface. Using floured fingertips, firmly press all over dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border</li>
        <li>Preheat to 500°F with a baking steel or large round cast-iron pizza pan (such as Lodge 15-inch) on middle rack. Let pan preheat in oven for about 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Form a C-shape with the outer edge of your hand, and press firmly inside dough border to define a 1/2-inch wide ring around edge of dough</li>
        <li>Lift dough onto the knuckles of both hands, and gently stretch, rotating dough after each stretch to maintain its round shape</li>
        <li>Continue gently stretching dough, allowing gravity to help it expand, until a 10-inch circle of even thickness forms, with a slightly thicker outer ring</li>
        <li>Lay dough round on a semolina-dusted pizza peel, reshaping as needed to form a circle. Spread dough round with Basic Pizza Sauce. Top with shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Gently shake pizza peel with prepared pie to loosen. If pizza feels stuck in any areas, carefully lift pizza edge with a bench scraper, and dust peel with a 1:1 mixture of semolina and bread flour. Unload pizza onto preheated pan in home oven, or onto stone in outdoor pizza oven using quick, decisive movements: Set the peel edge on the pan at about a 20-degree angle, and quickly pull back peel to slide half of the pizza onto the pan. Gently shake the peel side to side while pulling it back to slide the rest of the pizza onto the pan, allowing it to stretch slightly.</li>
        <li>Bake at 500°F until edges of crust have puffed slightly, about 3 minutes. Rotate pan 90 degrees, and increase oven temperature to broil. Broil until pizza is cooked through and crust is browned, 3 to 6 minutes</li>
        <li>Using peel, transfer pizza to a cutting board. Garnish with fresh basil or oregano, if desired, and cut into wedges</li>
    </ol>
